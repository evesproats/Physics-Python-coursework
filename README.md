This repository contains old coursework projects from the Computational Physics module I took during my 2nd year of my Physics BSc. It demonstrates the progress made over the course of the module.

The first project aims to find the spreading law of a liquid drop that spreads out over time. The code plots the empirical data, finds uncertainties and averages the radii over time across the three sets of data. **
